My repo while doing the Inception project for 42 School AngoulÃªme

This project is meant to get us to learn about Docker containers, and how to run multiple containers to make a small server, using nginx, mariadb, and Wordpress, setting up a few specific parameters, and running all of them together via docker-compose

Status: In progress..
